Creating a sun-tracking solar panel using Arduino can significantly increase the efficiency of solar panels by ensuring they always face the sun. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create such a system:

Components Needed:
Arduino UNO or any compatible Arduino board
Servo Motors (2, one for horizontal and one for vertical movement)
LDRs (Light Dependent Resistors) (4, to detect the direction of the light)
Resistors (10k ohms for LDRs)
Solar Panel
Breadboard and Jumper Wires
Power Supply (Battery or USB)

Basic Idea:
Use four LDRs to detect the intensity of light from different directions.
Use two servo motors to adjust the position of the solar panel horizontally and vertically based on the readings from the LDRs.

Circuit Diagram:
Connect the components as follows:
LDRs: Connect each LDR in series with a 10k ohm resistor. Connect the junction of each LDR and resistor to the analog input pins of the Arduino (e.g., A0, A1, A2, A3). Connect one end of the LDRs to 5V and the other end of the resistors to GND.
Servos: Connect the control wires of the servos to PWM pins on the Arduino (e.g., D9 and D10). Connect the power and ground pins of the servos to the 5V and GND of the Arduino.
Solar Panel: Connect the solar panel to a load or a battery for charging.

Explanation:
LDRs: These sensors detect light intensity. By placing them at different positions, we can determine the direction of the strongest light source (the sun).
Servo Motors: These are used to adjust the solar panel's position. One controls the horizontal axis (X-axis) and the other controls the vertical axis (Y-axis).
Arduino Code: The code reads the values from the LDRs, calculates the average light intensity in different directions, and adjusts the position of the servos to point the solar panel towards the sun.

Additional Considerations:
Fine-tune the threshold value to get more accurate tracking.
You might need to adjust the servo angle increments based on the responsiveness and resolution of your servos.
Consider adding a delay to avoid excessive movement and to give the system time to stabilize.
This setup should provide a basic but functional sun-tracking solar panel system.
